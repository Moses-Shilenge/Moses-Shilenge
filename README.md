😁 Hi there 👋 - I am a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving through modeling. Primarily, my programming model is OOP, and I have adopted C# and Java in OOP as my languages of choice. However, I don't limit myself. I am always keen on taking on a challenge. 

I enjoy front-end development and take pride in delivering client-facing applications that provide value to users. 

Furthermore, I also love sharing knowledge. I am interested in shaping the next generation of software engineers in our country and around the globe. My primary method is via my YouTube channel, "I Am Moshe." I Am Moses will live on in the minds of future developers 🤭.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on "I Am Moshe" 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java spring boot framework**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **React open source project**
- 🤔 I’m looking for a mentor, a person who can help me grow my skill to take on a **CIO** role.
- 💬 Ask me about anything pretty much. I try my best to master as many things as I can in IT.
- 📫 How to reach me: on YouTube @iammoshe
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an Otaku.
